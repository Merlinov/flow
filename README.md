# flow
Ambition: a product line of sculpted split ergo mech keyboards.

## Motivation
The intention of these keyboards is to combine the comfort of a split ergo keyboard with integrated trackball, and the style of a polished product. 

## Process
These keyboards began as dactyl manuforms. The dactyl generators are great to quickly optimize key position, tenting angle etc. Once the design was comfortable, the dactyl design was imported into Fusion 360. The key placement from the dactyl was used as a template for the flow keyboard series. 

A point of complaint, I found that comfortable trackball placement was quite difficult to find and required MANY printed iterations. It was only after using the funcitonal prototype that I could nail down why it wasn't comfortable, leading the the next series of changes.

## MX and choc differences
Through a period of discovery, I found the comfortable position of the trackball relative to the positioning of the thumb keys to be quite different between the choc and MX switches. For this reason, the choc and MX versions are quite different. The thickness of the key matrices are different as well, but I initially thought that could be overcome by some clever design feature. However once I figured that the trackball positions also had to be different, two designs was the only path forward.

Since I was making 2 keyboards, I thought it would be fun to try a dramatically different key matrix design. The philosophy of the thumb keys is mostly the same between MX and choc.

## Key Attributes
- integrated 34mm trackball using the PMW3360 sensor
- ceramic trackball bearings
- options for both choc v1 switches (40 keys) and MX switches (36 keys)
- USB-C interlink cable
- trays for PI Pico and Pro Micro
